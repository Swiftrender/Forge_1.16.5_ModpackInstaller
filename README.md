Not sure how to start this. lmao I'll get to it.

Here's a direct copypaste from the script!
Thanks for downloading Swirren's modpack installer. If the console reports any errors that re-running the program does not fix, send the "log.srr" file located in this folder to Swirren#8879 on Discord.

Since it's understandable that users might be skeptical about the safety of the program (Windows Defender gets angry at this since I don't have a digital signature) I'll probably make a Google Document or something explaining how everything works. It'll help get my final ideas out as well.

If there's any additional incentive needed to view the explanation document, it will list and explain developer keys that can be used to do some additional things behind the scenes.

uhhh... that's it
